## Project Overview
This project gives MTN a clear picture of customer churn in Q1 2025. It highlights how big the issue is, which customers are most likely to leave and what’s pushing them to switch. With these insights, MTN can focus on smarter retention efforts, sharpen the customer experience and stay ahead of competitors in the next quarter.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Cleaned the data using Power Query
- Used DAX expression to calculate the total number of customers, total revenue, number of churned customers and churn percentage.
- Created a calendar table using DAX to improve time reporting structure, which was linked to the main dataset (date table) using a (many-to-one) data modelling technique

## Data Visualisation 
- Created KPI cards showing the total number of customers, total revenue, churn percentage and the total number of churned customers.
- Bar chart showing the reasons customers are leaving
- A map chart showing the distribution of churned customers across Nigeria
- Line chart showing the number of customers lost monthly
- A column chart showing the rating of customers for our services
- Ratio of male to female churned customers
- A column chart showing the age-group distribution of churned customers
- filters for MTN device, gender, churn rate and date
